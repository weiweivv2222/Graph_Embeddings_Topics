EDA exploratry data analysis
Goal: understand the data: is feature significant, are some features correlated, missing data for feature, identify outliers  

assuming we have a clean dataset (no need to check missing value and duplicate)

analyse relationships between variables:
	
1 correlation matrix: shows correlation coefficient between variable
	to see paterns
	interesting link with scatter plot
	careful, only linear
2 scatter plot: graph x/y->one feature/other feature 
	to understand relationship, identify outlier/extreme values
	(pairplot is alle possible scatter plot combinaisons)
3a histogram: for one continuous variable, shows distribution of variable value 
3b bar graph: shows distribution for discrete data
4 Boxplot: visualise edistribution of the data (outlier(<3/2 of quartile)|"maximum"|upperquartile(25% of data greater than value)|median|lowerquartile|"min"|outlier)
	detect outliers, visualise centrale tnedency
5 look at descriptive statistics:
	Central tendency: location of distribution
		- Mean: average of values
		- median: second quantile, 50% value are below, 50% above
		- mode: most frequent value
	Variance: how values are similar/different
		- range: maximum-minimum
		- standard deviation: average of distance with the mean
		- interquantile range: difference between Q3 and Q1
